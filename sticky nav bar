      <p>JAWA (Czech pronunciation: [java]) is a motorcycle and moped manufacturer founded in Prague, Czechoslovakia in 1929 by František Janeček,[3] who bought the motorcycle division of Wanderer. The name JAWA was established by concatenating the first letters of Janeček and Wanderer.[4] In the past, especially in the 1950s, JAWA was one of the top motorcycle manufacturers and exported its 350 model into over 120 countries.[5] The best known model was the 350 Pérák and in the 1970s the 350 Californian. It appeared in the typical black and red coloring from Californian beaches to New Zealand.[6] After 1990, a significant loss of production occurred. A successor company was formed in 1997 in Týnec nad Sázavou, continuing the name as JAWA Moto.</p>
